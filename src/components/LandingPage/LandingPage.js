                <p>To make a new recipe, click the '+' icon at the top of the list of recipes.
                This will take you to a form where you can add the title and the url where you got the recipe. You can copy and paste the list of ingredients in the third box.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the best results, please make sure each ingredient is on its own line. Please keep a space between a the amount and unit.
                </p>
                <p>For example, ' 1/2 cup ' would work with slice, but ' 1/2cup ' would not.</p>



                <p>Sliced does not pick up measurements inside an ingredients title :</p>
                <p>Please use unformatted fractions.
                </p>
                <p>For example, input ' 1/4 ', not ' Â¼ '</p>
